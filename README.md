# Procrastination Timer üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: GLITCH


### Team Members
- Team Lead: [Fathima P Ajvad] - [ASIET]
- Member 2: [Nandana Ramachandran] - [ASIET]

### Project Description
[This project is a humorous and self-aware "Procrastination Timer." It's a technically functional but ultimately useless web app that mocks productivity culture with features like an AI-generated roast, and speech synthesis to read the jokes aloud.]

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
[Our project is a humorous and self-aware "Procrastination Timer." I'm not solving a real problem; instead, I'm providing a technically over-engineered and useless solution to the non-problem of celebrating and mocking the act of procrastination itself.]

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
[We're not actually solving a problem! Instead, We're comically embracing it. The project is an ironic "solution" to the "problem" of wanting to procrastinate more effectively. It's a digital monument to putting things off, complete with a timer that judges you, an AI that roasts you for your laziness, and other features that serve no purpose other than to be silly and self-aware.]

](Add photo of final product here)
The final version of this project is a single-page HTML application designed to be a humorous and self-aware "Procrastination Timer." It's built using HTML, a CDN-based Tailwind CSS for styling, and JavaScript for all the logic. The core functionality includes a countdown timer, a progress bar, and customizable work/break durations. The project's humor comes from its "useless" but technically functional features, such as the Gemini API which provides sarcastic roasts, and the Web Speech API which reads messages aloud. All these elements work together to create a lighthearted and ironic take on a standard productivity tool.
