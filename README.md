# [Procrastination Timer] üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: [GLITCH]


### Team Members
- Team Lead: [Fathima P Ajvad] - [ASIET]
- Member 2: [Nandana Ramachandran] - [ASIET]

### Project Description
[This project is a humorous and self-aware "Procrastination Timer." It's a technically functional but ultimately useless web app that mocks productivity culture with features like an AI-generated roast, and speech synthesis to read the jokes aloud.]

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
[Our project is a humorous and self-aware "Procrastination Timer." I'm not solving a real problem; instead, I'm providing a technically over-engineered and useless solution to the non-problem of celebrating and mocking the act of procrastination itself.]

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
[We're not actually solving a problem! Instead, We're comically embracing it. The project is an ironic "solution" to the "problem" of wanting to procrastinate more effectively. It's a digital monument to putting things off, complete with a timer that judges you, an AI that roasts you for your laziness, and other features that serve no purpose other than to be silly and self-aware.]
